<h2 align='center'>Welcome to Kavelag ! ü¶á</h2>
<h3 align='center'>v1.0</h3>
</br>

Kavelag is a lightweight proxy that lets you simulate common network problems in order to test your application's behavior under stressful conditions.

The app sits between your client and server, intercepting, parsing, and forwarding requests to the destination server before returning the response to the client. This allows you to test how your application behaves when things don't go as expected, at various stages of the HTTP lifecycle.

The core Kavelag is open-source and is currently available as a desktop application for Windows, with Mac and Linux versions arriving soon. ‚ú®
